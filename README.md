`rtop` is a remote system monitor. It connects over SSH to a remote system
and displays vital system metrics (CPU, disk, memory, network). No special
software is needed on the remote system, other than an SSH server and
working credentials.

Only Linux systems can be monitored, but most modern distros will work.

`rtop` is MIT-licensed and can be used anywhere with attribution.

*`rtop`'s [home page](http://www.rtop-monitor.org/) has more information
and screenshots!*

## build

`rtop` is written in [go](http://golang.org/), and needs just one dependent
library [x/crypto](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/). `rtop` does not use any
dependency managers, just a git submodule. Follow these steps to build:

    git clone --recursive http://github.com/rapidloop/rtop
    cd rtop
    make

The `--recursive` option will pull in the git submodule also. If you forget
to use the flag, try `make init`.

## contribute

Pull requests welcome. Keep it simple.
